			<p>In June of 2022, the Supreme Court reversed nearly 50 years of precedent and overturned the constitutional right to an abortion which was first established in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that previous rulings had "enflamed debate and deepened division" in the country. But when examining public opinion polling conducted by Gallup since 1975, a different conclusion can be drawn: a majority of Americans are seeking a middle-of-the-road approach to an issue that has galvanized passionate activism on both sides.</p>

	<p>Today, across America, a patchwork of state laws provide women varying degrees of access to abortion services. Some states have applied a "gestational limit," prohibiting abortions after a set number of weeks in the pregnancy. Others have enshrined new protections into law. Still other states have had their restrictions blocked or disputed by a court.

	<p> Dana Balter ran for Congress in Central New York twice as a Democrat; once in 2018, and again in 2020. Though she came up short in both campaigns, she is still engaged in political issues, teaching at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.</p>
	<p>She sees the issue of abortion rights in America as a critical example of where public discussion and debate have failed voters and led to misconceptions about what she and other candidates actually support. Some of the blame for that confusion, she says, falls on members of the media.

			<h3>Meet the press</h3>
			<p>"In my campaigns, I talked about this issue a lot, and tried to get the press to talk about it a lot because it's so important."</p>
			<p>As a candidate for Congress, Balter wanted local media to report concerns surrounding women's rights. She says it was difficult to convince them to do so because the issue did not receive much national attention until Roe was ultimately overturned.</p>
			<p>"I think it is really going to be a central issue in the 2024 elections, particularly federally" Balter said, "because the way that we are going to be able to prevent the rollbacks of rights at the state level is with federal protections."</p>
			<p>She's hopeful that members of her party will regain full control of Congress and the White House and could pass a national law reinstating the protections once guaranteed by the Supreme Court under Roe. That platform, Balter believes, will be popular for voters in the upcoming election.</p>
			<p>When reflecting on the polling numbers from Gallup, Balter says that public opinion is "really important," but that discussions of policy need to be deeper and more nuanced than the results of a survey.</p>
			<p>"We need to really understand what people who are asking for our votes think, what they value, and what they will do in office," Balter said.</p>
			<p>She says the press has a critical role in presenting the truth to voters. On this issue especially, she says, "we hear a lot of nonsense."</p>
			<p>"We hear so much misinformation in order to justify their positions, people will say things that just aren't true."</p>

			<h3>Deeply personal</h3>
			<p>There is a distinction between answering abstract questions from a pollster about hypothetical legislation and hearing the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/13/1218953788/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-kate-cox#:~:text=Cox%20family-,Kate%20Cox%20left%20Texas%20to%20end%20her%20pregnancy.,that%20threaten%20her%20future%20fertility.&text=Although%20a%20district%20court%20judge,to%20the%20Texas%20Supreme%20Court." target="_blank">emotional story</a> of a woman actually affected by the laws in question. In the past few weeks, a Texas woman named Kate Cox sought an abortion in her home state that her doctors said was medically necessary. The state's highest court denied her request.</p>
			<p>It is real and difficult stories like Kate's that Balter says need to be at the center of any conversation about the future of abortion rights in America.</p>
			<p> "If you want to really have reasonable positions and reasonable laws, you've got to be honest about what the issues are," Balter said. "That context and that reality has to be part of any reasonable discussion about the issue."</p>
			<p>As for politicians who deceive voters about this sensitive subject, Balter's message is clear.</p>
			<p>"On this issue, like on any other, if you have to lie to justify your position, then you don't belong in public office."</p>

		<h3>Testing, testing</h3>
		<p>In 1932, writing the dissenting opinion in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis first popularized the theory of states acting as a "laboratory" of democracy, where citizens may choose to "try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."</p>
		<p>Though a majority of voters tell Gallup that they support "some restrictions" on abortion, thanks to the Supreme Court, it is now in the hands of our elected leaders in all 50 democracy laboratories to determine what those restrictions will be.</p>
